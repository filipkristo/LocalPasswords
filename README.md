# Local Passwords Application
Windows 10 Universal Application - keep your passwords secure
## Some features:
* Using AES 256 encryption
* This application doesn't have permission for internet access, so your passwords are safe
* You can save encrypted file to one drive and sync with multiple devices
* Can work with any Win 10 device
* Using new Win 10 universal engine and modern design
* Open source and available for any developers to join and improve application

## Application is currently in beginning of development, you can install, but there is no much functionality....

## Why I want to develop local password manager:
* Good way to explore Windows 10 UWP platform
* Most secure way to store passwords, application will not require internet access permissions, or any other
* You can save with file picker to onedrive without internet access permission and sync with other devices
* Explore new windows 10 libraries, responsive and adaptive design
* Create new file extension protocol, so you can easily import data...
